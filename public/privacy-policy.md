# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 27, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how justcalendar.ai ("Just Calendar", "we", "our", "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use https://justcalendar.ai.

By using the website, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Process

### A) Information stored in your browser (local-only app data)
Just Calendar stores your calendar app data in your own browser via `localStorage` so the app can remember your content and preferences. This can include:

- Calendar definitions (names, types, colors, pinned state)
- Day values and notes entered in the calendar
- Theme and UI tuning preferences

This `localStorage` data remains on your device/browser unless you clear it.

### B) Google Drive connection data (optional feature)
If you choose **Login to Google Drive**, we process OAuth tokens to connect your account:

- Requested scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
- We do **not** request Google Sign-In, `email`, or `profile` scopes for this connection
- Refresh/access tokens are stored server-side (not in browser `localStorage`)

Tokens are used only to maintain the Google Drive connection and request valid access tokens when needed.

### C) Analytics and technical usage data
The site uses Google Analytics (Measurement ID: `G-NWX6ELVVTS`), which may collect data such as:

- Device/browser details
- Page views and interaction events
- IP-based and referral-related analytics information

Google may use cookies or similar technologies for analytics.

### D) Basic technical logs
As with most websites, hosting/network infrastructure may process standard technical request data (for example IP address, user agent, request times) for reliability and security.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Provide and operate the calendar application
- Persist your settings and calendar state
- Support optional Google Drive authentication/connection
- Monitor performance and improve the website
- Protect service security and integrity
- Comply with legal obligations

## 3. How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information.

Information may be shared with:

- Service providers required to operate the website (for example hosting and analytics)
- Google, when you explicitly choose to connect Google Drive
- Authorities/law enforcement where legally required

## 4. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We and our service providers may use cookies or similar technologies for:

- Analytics
- Security/session management for OAuth flows

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Some functionality may be affected.

## 5. Data Retention

- Browser `localStorage` data is kept until you clear browser storage.
- OAuth tokens are retained server-side until you disconnect Google Drive or tokens are revoked/invalidated.
- Analytics and infrastructure logs are retained according to provider/system policies.

## 6. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of storage or transmission is completely secure, so absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## 7. Your Choices

You can:

- Clear `localStorage` in your browser to remove locally stored app data
- Disconnect Google Drive from the app
- Revoke app access in your Google account permissions
- Limit cookies/analytics via browser settings and available browser privacy controls

## 8. Children's Privacy

This website is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 9. International Users

Depending on where you access the service, your information may be processed in countries outside your jurisdiction.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with an updated **Last Updated** date.
